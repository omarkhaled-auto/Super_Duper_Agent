Build "FlowBoard" — a modern, real-time project management dashboard inspired by Linear.

Design reference: https://linear.app (scrape the design language — colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, the sidebar navigation, the clean minimalism)

Tech stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, Socket.io for real-time.

## Core Features

### Authentication
- Email/password signup & login with JWT
- Protected routes, session persistence
- User avatar & profile settings

### Dashboard (Home)
- Project cards with progress indicators (tasks done / total)
- Recent activity feed (real-time via WebSocket)
- Quick-add task shortcut
- "My tasks" summary with due-date awareness

### Kanban Board View
- Drag-and-drop columns: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done
- Smooth animations on card movement
- Card shows: title, priority badge (Urgent/High/Medium/Low with color), assignee avatar, due date
- Inline quick-edit on cards
- Add new card inline at bottom of each column
- Column task count badges

### List View (Table)
- Sortable columns: title, status, priority, assignee, due date, created
- Multi-select with bulk actions (change status, assign, delete)
- Inline editing for status and priority
- Pagination with items-per-page selector

### Task Detail Panel
- Slide-over panel from right side (not a new page)
- Rich text description (use a markdown editor)
- Status, priority, assignee, due date fields
- Activity log / comments section
- Sub-tasks with checkbox completion
- Labels/tags with color coding
- Created/updated timestamps

### Projects
- Create/edit/archive projects
- Project-level settings (name, description, icon, color)
- Member management (invite by email, role: admin/member/viewer)
- Per-project Kanban and List views

### Search & Keyboard Shortcuts
- Global search (Cmd/Ctrl+K) — searches tasks, projects, and members
- Keyboard shortcuts: N for new task, B for board view, L for list view
- Command palette style UI

### Real-Time
- WebSocket for live updates — when one user moves a task, all connected users see it instantly
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Online presence indicators (who's viewing the board)

### Dark/Light Mode
- System preference detection with manual toggle
- Smooth theme transition
- Both themes must look equally polished

### Analytics Page
- Tasks completed over time (area chart)
- Tasks by status (donut chart)
- Tasks by priority distribution (bar chart)
- Team velocity (tasks completed per week, line chart)
- Use Recharts for all visualizations

### Responsive Design
- Full desktop experience
- Tablet: collapsible sidebar
- Mobile: bottom navigation, swipeable kanban columns

## Non-Functional Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- API input validation with Zod
- Proper error handling with toast notifications
- Loading skeletons (not spinners) for all data-fetching states
- Optimistic updates for all mutations
- 20+ tests covering critical paths (auth flow, task CRUD, drag-and-drop state, API endpoints)
- Seed script that populates demo data (3 projects, 30+ tasks, 3 users) so the app looks alive on first run
- Clean folder structure: monorepo with /client and /server directories

Make it beautiful. Make it feel fast. Make it feel like a real product, not a demo.
